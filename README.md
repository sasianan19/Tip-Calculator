# Don't Be a Jerk- Tip Your Server
### *unless they were terrible, then maybe not*

Welcome to my handy-dandy tip calculator! 🍽️


This program can be used to...
- Calculate tip/s 💅
- Calculate bill total 💸
- Split a bill 👯


By following these steps:
1. Enter the cost of your meal.
2. If the bill is being split, enter the # of people (enter 0 if you got it like that or you dined solo).
3. Enter the tip percentage you would like to leave (or 0 if your service was trash).
3. a. You will be asked if you would like to leave another tip. If you're feeling generous, answer "yes" until your wallet is empty (haha jk). Otherwise, answer "no". 
4. After answering "no", your bill total will populate. If you split the bill, the amount each person is responsible for paying will also populate. 


I hope you find this tool to be of good use! Happy eating! 🍜
